Group 2

Task 1: not passed
 a1: not correct 
     - very confusing with two variables named x
     - a few implications are wrong (e.g. if x + b is in A it does not follow in general that x is in A for every b in B)
     - final implication not clear
 a2: not correct (similar to a1)
 b1: mostly correct
 b2: mostly correct
 -> could be more precise regarding the A_1 as a subset of A_2
 b3: correct
 b4: not correct: complements for closing/openings not shown

-> We could see that you tried for this task, but unfortunately this was not enough for a pass
 

Task 2: passed
 mostly correct -> only small mistake: order of output vector is wrong

Task 3: not passed
 a: not correct -> x_k^(0) does not equal 0 for all k in {2,...,L+M} -> Tip: You should have shown which parts of the sum become 0 if n < 2 or n > L+M
 b: partly correct, very short (recall to Task 3a could be helpful
 c: not correct -> only shown for special case

In Total:
 1/3
