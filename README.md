This is the homework repository of Mathematical Image Processing in winter term 2022 / 2023. Theoretical problems and coding assignments will be uploaded weekly to this repository. In this course, we will use *Matlab* and *Octave* (see Task 1 + 2 of [Tutorial](https://writemd.rz.tuhh.de/ohfOWSleRbmCFNfWs0QHLw)).

## General information

Theoretical and coding problems will be uploaded as a .pdf-file. For each coding assignment, we will provide a template for your solution. Additonally, we will provide a test file where you can test your code. Note that passing all the tests does not mean that your implementation is correct.

## Set up your Copy of this Repository

- Install *Git* and set up *GitLab* (Task 3 + 4 of [Tutorial](https://writemd.rz.tuhh.de/ohfOWSleRbmCFNfWs0QHLw))
- Download the export file of the Original Repository from [Stud.IP page](https://e-learning.tuhh.de/studip/dispatch.php/course/files?cid=213e1d92365da84887f76fde812cc593) and import as project (Task 5 of [Tutorial](https://writemd.rz.tuhh.de/ohfOWSleRbmCFNfWs0QHLw)).
- Add your team members and *Hendrik Gr√ºnhagen* to your repository with *Maintainer* role.

## Handing in your Solutions + Getting your Markings

The last line of each .m-file (except for the test suites) reads %by NAME. Change NAME to the full names of all team members. Please upload your solution of the theoretical probelms as a .pdf-file to your repository. 

In order to hand in your solutions, you need to `push` your local changes to your remote repository (see Task 5 of [Tutorial](https://writemd.rz.tuhh.de/ohfOWSleRbmCFNfWs0QHLw)). Your corrector will push a document containing your marking to your repository afterwards. 

## Getting Updates from the Original Repository

Set up the original repository as a further remote (in command line):

`git remote add upstream https://collaborating.tuhh.de/e-10/teaching/mathematical-image-processing/mathimproc-wt2022`

Optionally, enter the following to prevent accidentally pushing to the wrong remote:

`git remote set-url --push upstream DISALLOWED`

Pull newest changes in the original repository:

`git pull upstream master`
