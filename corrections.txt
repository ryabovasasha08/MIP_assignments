Group 2

Task 1: passed
 a: correct
 b: correct
 c: mostly correct (your interpolation function does not work as it is not equal to 0 for every integer different from 0 -> for x = 2 it is equal to -1)
 d: correct

Task 2: passed
 correct 
 Eye test looks incorrect, there seems to be a small mistake in your code for the blinear method. 
 If you turn ratio*(...+...) into ratio*(...) + ratio*(....) in lines 27 and 32, the error is gone.
 This seems to be a numerical error of the computation.

Task 3: not passed
 Bilinear method is missing
 Mistake with Rotation center, should be (m+1)/2 and (n+1)/2
